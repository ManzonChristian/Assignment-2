        My name is John Christian B. Manzon I was born on the 6th of September in year 2000, which means that I am 20
        years old now.I am the eldest in the family and i have 1 younger brother.
        Then I have got my mom and dad too. I'm not close to my brother, However, I do love my brother very much.I have
        been living and studying in Bicol untill I was grade 8, then I moved to
        Pangasinan with my family. I finished off my highschool and is now currently at 2nd year in college.I love going
        to school and I have always taken my studies very seriously. I have never
        said to anyone in my life, that 'I hate studies'. Many people find me as a geek, but I only see that as a
        compliment rather than an insult. I have got big dreams, when it comes to studies.
        Since I was 6 years old, I decided to be a Programmer. So that is my goal and I always try to aim to do my best
        at school, so hopefully my hard work will pay off in the end. I don't really know why I decided to be a
        Programmer. I just love Computers. Some interests I have got are; reading Manga and Novel, Watching Anime, programming and
        cooking. I love to read manga and novel, because books can always be true friends. They never demand neither do
        they complain.
        This is the way I look upon books. Currently I am reading a novel called "The Second Coming of Glutony".Moving
        on to favourite Anime; No Game No Life, Jujutsu Kaisen, Cowboy Bepop,and Code Geass. Basically the list can go
        on and on.
        I must be up to date with the latest anime.Cooking has been a huge interest of mine. My mom's a great cook-
        especially in asian cooking. I think I have got it from her. From my point of view, having learned how to cook,
        makes a persons life much easier.
